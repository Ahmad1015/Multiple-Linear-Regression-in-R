# Multiple Linear Regression Project in R

This project demonstrates the implementation of multiple linear regression in R. Multiple linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used to predict a numerical target variable based on multiple input features.

## Overview

In this project, we will:

- Import and explore a dataset.
- Preprocess the data, including encoding categorical variables.
- Split the dataset into a training set and a test set for model evaluation.
- Fit a multiple linear regression model to the training set.
- Predict the target variable for the test set.
- Perform backward elimination for feature selection.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following R packages installed:

- ggplot2 for data visualization
- caTools for dataset splitting

You can install them using the `install.packages()` function:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("caTools")
```
## Usage
1) Clone this repository (if you haven't already):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad1015/Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R.git
cd Multiple-Linear-Regression-in-R
```
2) Launch RStudio and set your working directory to the cloned repository.
3) Open the multiple_linear_regression.R script in RStudio.
4) Follow the step-by-step instructions in the script to understand and implement multiple linear regression in R.
